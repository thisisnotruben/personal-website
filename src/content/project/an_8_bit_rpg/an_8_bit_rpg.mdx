This is what's latest in development, the aim for this game is a top
down RPG game, heavily inspired from a video game I use to play in
the past: [Gurk, the 8-bit RPG](https://gurk.fandom.com/wiki/Gurk,_the_8-bit_RPG_Wikia).
What I aim for this latest project of mine is implementing what I
lacked in my prior game of Starship Invasion: units with specific
roles and behaviors that allow for more enjoyable experiance.

So far the breakthoughs have been made in implementing character
behaviors through behavior trees as to where in Starship Invasion
there was none and just Finte State Machines (FSM) where used for
that.

Super excited to get this out as I see it avenges one of my failed
works in the past, and it fulfills one of my childhood dreams of
making an RPG game. Hopefully with my prior experiance, this will be
the a banger for sure.

Inspirations:
