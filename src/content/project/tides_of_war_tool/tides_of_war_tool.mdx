Here's a tool I made to aid the development of Tides of War.
It was made using python coupled with the Qt-Framework for the
front-end GUI. The GUI was made in [QT-Creator](https://www.qt.io/development/tools/qt-creator-ide)
and it did help in the creation of some standardized data templates
I was making for the game.

The main takeaway from this project was to tinker around using the
QT-framework, in which I had a lot of fun but unfortunately in retrospect it
could've been better. What I would do different today would be to
containerize the program so I can at least run it again. Other than
that would to seperate the code into a MVC design pattern.
