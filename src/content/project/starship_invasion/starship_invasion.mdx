Now for something I'm actually proud of and took about four months
of development. I present to you this Doom-like inspired shooter in
which I feel is quite the enjoyable experiance. As a one-man-team I
like the art syle I took this on, a pixel-art view projected to a 3D
space.

When creating this game I took on many different inspirations from
past video games I've played and movies I watch. Them being:

- [Doom](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Doom)

It's obvious that the gameplay mechanics of Doom is
something I wanted to replicate. Though looking back after
my published game. If I were to change one thing right now
about my game: it would have a cooldown for shooting the gun
as sort of an overheating mechanic so you don't spam the
shoot action.

- [Dead Space](https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Space_(2008))

The inspiration I got is the objective marker, I loved that
simple mechanic in the game and transferred it to mine.

- [Starcraft](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/StarCraft:_Brood_War)

No mechanic taken from this RTS game, however I'd like to
showcase this cinematic video in which I took great
inspiration from in the form of atmosphere that I desired to
replicate. Everything about that cinematic is a chef's kiss.
The narrow corridors and lighting in this cinematic is
exactly what I wanted to convey.

Reflecting on my game and Strarcraft, improvements would be
adding more Sfx and having more enemy units that have a specific
role in which they 'deal' with you. I loved the graphics and the
lighting I put in the game though sometimes playing in this
pixel-art view, I think would it be better in a voxel format
instead?
