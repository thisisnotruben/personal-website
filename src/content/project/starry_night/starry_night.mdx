This was a quick and dirty game I made to just get back in the
rhythm and mindset of starting and ending a project. It was meant
for a game jam over a weekend but I didn't make the deadline
(whoops)... so it was made in about two weeks. Anyways the controls
are clunky and the gameplay is questionable?
