This is my first project into game development to where I let my
imagination run wild and the project came to a hault due to scope
creep and not having experiance. It was intended to be an RPG game
with four playable levels that are in different biomes:

- Forest
- Swampland
- Desert
- Mystical forset
- Evil land

Each biomes has their own unique units that were created by me.
Though I cherish my art creations, they're not up to standards in
creating a "stimulating" visual for a gameplay experiance.

I'm embarrassed to say that this unreleased project took over two
years of development. However, with that time being recklessly spent,
it was indeed a learning process and introduction to this space.
